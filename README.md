# **Switched and Variable-Gain Higher-Order Sliding Mode Control**  

This repository provides an implementation of the methods described in the paper:  

**"[A General Framework for Switched and Variable-Gain Higher-Order Sliding Mode Control](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2020.2996423)"**  
by *Gian Paolo Incremona, Matteo Rubagotti, Mara Tanelli, and Antonella Ferrara* (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2021).  

## **Overview**  
This project implements the higher-order sliding mode control framework proposed in the paper. It includes:  
- **Switched and Variable-Gain HOSM Controllers**  
- **Chattering Reduction Techniques**  
- **Simulations and Performance Evaluation**
